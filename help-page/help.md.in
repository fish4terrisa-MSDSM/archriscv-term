% Arch Linux riscv64 on Android

This is an application emulating a headless riscv64 machine which runs an
[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) operating system.

Arch Linux riscv64 Term is based on sources of [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)
which is a terminal emulator for Android. Core of this application is the
[QEMU](https://qemu.org) - a generic and open source machine emulator and
virtualizer.

### Features

### User interface
#### Main menu

On application's cold start you will see a main menu. It allows to
select a desired action you want to perform, for example launch
virtual machine or open settings.

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
<img alt="Application menu screenshot" src="img/app_menu.jpg" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

Description for menu entries:

 - **Launch**

   Launch the virtual machine in normal mode.

 - **Launch in sandbox mode**

   Launch the virtual machine in "sandbox" mode. All file system
   changes will not be saved in this mode.

 - **Settings**

   Open application's settings.

 - **Help**

   Show the help page you reading now.

 - **Exit**

   Exit the application.


Besides the main menu there are five additional interface elements
available: a [context menu](#context-menu), [navigation drawer](#navigation-drawer),
[notification](#notification), [extra keys row](#extra-keys-row)
and [text input view](#text-input-view). These additional elements
become available when the virtual machine is running.

#### Context menu

The context menu can be shown by long pressing anywhere on the
terminal. It provides menu entries for:

 - Showing this help page.
 - Choosing font and color scheme for styling the terminal.
 - Selecting and pasting text.
 - Sharing text from the terminal to other apps (e.g. email or SMS).
 - Resetting the terminal if it gets stuck.
 - A setting to control whether back key should send ESC.
 - A setting to control whether bell characters should be ignored.

#### Navigation drawer

The navigation drawer is revealed by swiping inwards from the left
part of the screen.

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Navigation drawer screenshot" src="img/app_drawer.jpg" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

 1. A list of sessions. Clicking on a session shows it in the
    terminal while long pressing allows you to specify a session title.
 2. A button to toggle visibility of the touch keyboard. Long
    press will toggle [extra keys row](#extra-keys-row) (3).

#### Notification

The notification shown while the Arch Linux riscv64 Term is running, is available
by pulling down the status bar.

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Notification screenshot" src="img/app_notification.jpg" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

Pressing the notification will open current terminal session. The
notification may also be expanded by pinch-zooming or performing
a single-finger glide to expose some actions:

 1. Immediately exit the application.
 2. Start wake lock to prevent device's CPU going into sleep mode.

#### Extra keys row

The extra keys row provides some keys frequently required in shell
sessions.

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Extra keys row screenshot" src="img/extra_keys_row.png" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

It can be toggled by: long-press on keyboard button located in the
[navigation drawer](#navigation-drawer), by using a **Volume Up+Q**
or **Volume Up+K** key combinations.

#### Text input view

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Text input view screenshot" src="img/alt_text_input.png" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

Terminal emulators usually do not support the advanced features of
touch keyboards like autocorrection, prediction and swipe typing.
To solve this, Arch Linux riscv64 Term has a text input view where all these
features work correctly. Text entered in it will get pasted to the
terminal. To access the text input view, swipe the [extra keys row](#extra-keys-row)
to the left side.

### Getting started
#### Terminal

Terminal is the important part of the Arch Linux riscv64 Term application.
It provides a text-based interface to a shell of the operating
system running inside the virtual machine.

When terminal is active, it is sensitive to taps and gestures.
For example, pinch-zooming will change text size and short tap
will act as mouse click. Long tap will toggle text selection
and [context menu](#context-menu).

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="QEMU session screenshot" src="img/qemu_session.jpg" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

Arch Linux riscv64 Term uses a fixed number of terminal sessions, each of
them has its own purpose. You cannot add new or remove existing
ones.

The first session is bootline console (BootLine0) 
which you can use to boot the system.
The second-fifth session is bootline console (ttyS0-ttyS3) 
which you can use to access the shell.

**Important**: serial console do not support automatic window
resizing. Unfortunately this issue comes from the nature of
serial console implementation and cannot be fixed. As workaround,
it is suggested to call command '**resize**' once you changed the
window size.

The sixth session is a QEMU monitor. It gives you full control
over QEMU's internal state.

#### Touch keyboard shortcuts

Use of keys like Alt, Ctrl, Esc is necessary for working with
many command line applications. Most of the Android touch
keyboards do not include these keys.

The result of using **Ctrl** in combination with a key depends
on which program is used, but for many command line tools the
following shortcuts work:

 - **Ctrl+A** → Move cursor to the beginning of line
 - **Ctrl+C** → Abort (send SIGINT to) current process
 - **Ctrl+D** → Logout of a terminal session
 - **Ctrl+E** → Move cursor to the end of line
 - **Ctrl+K** → Delete from cursor to the end of line
 - **Ctrl+L** → Clear the terminal
 - **Ctrl+Z** → Suspend (send SIGTSTP to) current process

**Volume Down** key used as Ctrl while the **Volume Up** key
is used to to produce certain input on these key combinations:

 - **Volume Up+.** → Ctrl+\\ (SIGQUIT)
 - **Volume Up+1** → F1 (and **Volume Up+2** → F2, etc)
 - **Volume Up+0** → F10
 - **Volume Up+A** → Left arrow key
 - **Volume Up+B** → Alt+B, back a word when using readline
 - **Volume Up+D** → Right arrow key
 - **Volume Up+E** → Escape key
 - **Volume Up+F** → Alt+F, forward a word when using readline
 - **Volume Up+H** → ~ (the tilde character)
 - **Volume Up+K** → Alias for **Volume Up+Q**
 - **Volume Up+L** → | (the pipe character)
 - **Volume Up+N** → Page Down
 - **Volume Up+P** → Page Up
 - **Volume Up+Q** → Toggle extra keys row
 - **Volume Up+S** → Down arrow key
 - **Volume Up+T** → Tab key
 - **Volume Up+U** → _ (the underscore character)
 - **Volume Up+V** → Show the volume control
 - **Volume Up+W** → Up arrow key
 - **Volume Up+X** → Alt+X

#### Hardware keyboard shortcuts

Following shortcuts in combination with **Ctrl+Alt** are available when using
a hardware keyboard:

 - **+/-** → Adjust text size
 - **1-5** → Go to numbered session
 - **M** → Show context menu
 - **N** → Switch to next session
 - **P** → Switch to previous session
 - **R** → Rename current session
 - **U** → Open URL selector
 - **V** → Paste clipboard
 - **Left arrow** → Close drawer
 - **Right arrow** → Open drawer
 - **Down arrow** → Alias for **N**
 - **Up arrow** → Alias for **P**

#### Settings

You can enter settings via [main menu](#main-menu).

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Application settings screenshot" src="img/app_settings.jpg" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

These settings affect options passed to the QEMU. Before changing
something, please read description of the each option carefully
and understand what you are actually doing. Default values should
be good for the most cases.

#### Exiting from application

Arch Linux riscv64 Term is not a regular application. Unless you are in a "sandbox"
mode, you cannot safely just close application. There a virtual machine
running inside, so before closing the application, it is highly recommended
to shut down the virtual machine by either command '**poweroff**' in
serial console or command '**system_powerdown**' in QEMU monitor.

Such measures required to prevent loss of data remaining in the buffers.
If you forget to do graceful shutdown, you may get a file system left
in inconsistent state or even get some files corrupted or lost (worst cases).
